 * Created by Саманцов on 05.06.2015.
 *
 * Problem:
 While performing improv, the first rule is to always
 say yes. The philosophy is, when you say 'no', the
 comedy dies. Martians have actually applied this
 philosophy to everything on Mars. They always reply
 in the affirmative. They say it is good for the soul.
 When this exercise is run, a Martian will ask you if
 you want to join them for a life changing adventure
 with them. You have to reply in the affirmative by
 printing the boolean value true.

 What we expect: When we run this exercise, we expect
 the boolean value, true, to be printed to the system
 console.

 Hint:
 You can use System.out.println() to print boolean
 constants to the system console.

 Learning Outcomes:
 After completing this exercise you should
 understand how to print a boolean constant
 to the system console.
