 * Problem:
 After saying hello to the Martians, you realize that they are very likeable, and amiable. You strike up a conversation with+
 one of them, and realize that most of the Martians who have landed on earth, are anywhere from 690 - 780 years old. Further you
 realize that the lifespan on Mars is exactly 1K years. Everyone on Mars lives for exactly 1024 years.
 They have been able to engineer their lifespan, to enable each Martian to create a personalized and optimal growth plan for themselves.
 In this exercise, you have to print the number 1024 to the system console.

 What we expect:
 When we run your program we expect 1024 to be printed to the system console.

 Hint:
 You can use System.out.println() to print a number to the system console.

 Learning Outcomes:
 After completing this exercise you should understand how to print an integer constant to the system console.
