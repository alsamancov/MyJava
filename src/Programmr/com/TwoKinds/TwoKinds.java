 * Problem:
 One day your Martian friend gets a bit
 philosophical and says. Basically, there are 10 kinds
 of people in this universe - those who get it and
 those who don't. Most people get it that the universe
 is basically a good place, and the human will has all
 the power to overcome suffering. He said that he
 longed to share this simple truth with everyone he met.
 The purpose of this exercise is to assign the boolean
 variable 'isGood' to an appropriate value such that
 the following line is printed when we run the program:
 "This universe is basically good - true"

 Hint:
 A boolean variable can take 10 values - true or false.

public class TwoKinds {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        boolean isGood = true;
        ///{
        System.out.println("This universe" +
                " is basically good - " + isGood);

        ///}
    }
}
